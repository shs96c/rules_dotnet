# This test makes sure that if we are depending on a package that is also included
# in a targeting pack that we chooset the highest version.
# Example: Microsoft.NETCore.App.Ref 6.0.0 contains the System.Text.Json reference DLL, but we
# can also depend on System.Text.Json 7.0.0 as a NuGet package. In that case we should use the
# 7.0.0 NuGet package and not the 6.0.0 targeting pack.
